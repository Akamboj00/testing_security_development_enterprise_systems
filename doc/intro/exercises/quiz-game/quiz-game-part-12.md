# Quiz Game - Part 12

This Quiz Game application can be extended in many different ways.
Here some ideas (but no solution provided):

* Give the ability to create and edit quizzes in the database directly
  from the web application.
  
* Create an `admin` role. For example, only an admin should be able to 
  edit quizzes.   

* Make sure that players cannot cheat. For example, currently a player could
  just log out to avoid answering a quiz s/he does not know.
