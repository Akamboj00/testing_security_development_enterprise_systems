## Exercises

There is no exercise with solutions in this course, as the group
exam will start soon after the first few classes.

If you have never used Kotlin before, it is recommended to do some
Kotlin Koans, like [this one](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html). 

Before the exam starts, it makes sense to develop a pet project to get practice.
In other words, choose a topic you like, and build a RESTful API for it.
Each class, when a new concept is introduced, extend your project with what
you learn.
