  # "Redis is an open-source in-memory database project implementing a distributed,
  # in-memory key-value store with optional durability."
  # We use it here to store session tokens, in a way in which all services can
  # quickly access it for authentication purposes.
  # Think about it like a hash-map that you can access remotely.

  # Note: for simplicity I am not starting any real database in this example.
  # I am going to use embedded H2 databases.
  # However, ideally I should start here on Postgres per service that needs
  # a database (eg, zuul and user-service here)
